# AI Sudoku with OrTools

First project with the Google ortools library to print a sudoku grid according to the difficulty's level chosen, and print the solution of this one. 
You can generate a grid with the code or give it a pre-filled grid and in this case, it will tell you if this grid is feasibleand print a solution if it has one.
<br>For the moment, there is only a raw code which displays the grid in the console, but I will soonly implement a graphical user interface.
